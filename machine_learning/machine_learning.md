# Machine Learning in 30 minutes
Getting started with machine learning (ml) can seem like a daunting task. Given that it's used to create self driving cars, Apple’s Siri and IBM’s Watson, it’s easy to to assume that this domain ought to be reserved for the Ph.D.’s.

But even though ml can be extremely complex, you only need to understand a tiny bit of it to get started. You probably didn’t understand HTTP very well when you built your first website, right? You had (and probably still have) frameworks to take care of that stuff. It's similar with machine learning; you'll have pre-written algorithms and modules that do most of the heavy lifting.

If you take this top down approach - as opposed to bottom up - you’ll find that doing machine learning is a lot easier that you might think. And you can train your first algorithm on day one.

This will of course give you a shallow introduction to the subject. However, it will give you a sense of victory, and perhaps give you some motivation to keep on going, which over time will lead you further down into the complexity behind the algorithms.

### Recognizing handwritten digits

So this [video tutorial](https://vimeo.com/128311179) is meant to help you take your first step into machine learning. It’s divided into two parts, and is about 30 minutes in total. We’ll use Python programming language, and its awesome Scikit Learn module, which contains a wealth of machine learning algorithms.

In the [first part](https://vimeo.com/128311179) I’ll explain what we’re trying to accomplish, which is to teach the computer how to recognize handwritten digits. We’ll have a look at the dataset (MNIST), how it’s structured and how the computer can interpret it. In addition to this, we’ll also have a look at our algorithm of choice, which is called K Nearest Neighbor.

In the [second part](https://vimeo.com/128293489), we’ll get your dependencies up and running, import the dataset and get going with the coding. We’ll train the algorithm with a few different sizes of data and have a look at how its success rate improves. 

I encourage you to code along while following the tutorial, thereby keeping the project as a reference on you computer. I also find that you learn a lot better this way, as oppose to just following it without coding.

The source code for the tutorial can be found on [this](https://github.com/perborgen/StupidMachine) Github repository.

Happy machine learning!
